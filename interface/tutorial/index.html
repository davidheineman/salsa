                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Welcome! In this project you will read simplified sentences generated by Artificial Intelligence and rate their quality.</p>

                <p>This qualification HIT will train you to perform this task. You must be able to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Find the changes our AI made (i.e. "<b><i>selecting spans</i></b>")</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the quality of each change</li>
                    <li>Identify errors in each change</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here's a big picture of what we're doing:</p>

            <tab-content title="Selecting Alignments">
                <h1>Selecting Alignments</h1>
                <p>We'll begin by understanding the ways our AI simplifies sentences.</p>
                <p>
                    Each independent piece of information in a sentence is called a <i>phrase</i>. Our AI may add, delete or modify the wording within a phrase. It may also re-order phrases or split a complex sentence into two sentences. Each individual change to the sentence is called an <i>edit</i>. Your task is to <i>align</i> the edits between the complex and simplified sentences. 
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Edits</h2>
                <p>
                    We see two classes of edits. <i>Phrase edits</i> which modify a single piece of information and <i>syntax edits</i> which modify the structure of the sentence. We begin by introducing the phrase edits:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <ed>Deletion Edits</ed> - The AI attempted to <b><i>simplify by deleting</i></b> unnecessary information.
                        </li><li>
                            <ei>Insertion Edits</ei> - The AI attempted to <b><i>add clarity</i></b> by adding information which didn't previously exist.
                        </li><li>
                            <es>Substitution Edits</es> - The AI attempted to <b><i>reword a complicated phrase or concept</i></b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The <i>syntax edits</i> will be less common, and will look very different from phrase edits:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <esp>Splitting Edits</esp> - The AI attemped to <b><i>split a complex sentence</i></b> into two simpler sentences.
                        </li><li>
                            <er>Reordering Edits</er> - The AI attempted to <b><i>re-order</i></b> the words within a phrase or phrases within a sentence.
                        </li><li>
                            <est>Structural Edits</est> - The AI attemped to <b><i>modify attributes</i></b> (like the tense, structure or voice) of the sentence to present information more clearly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> <i>Phrase edits</i> and <i>syntax edits</i> are independent of each other! A single word can be a part of both a <i>phrase edit</i> <b><i>and</i></b> a <i>syntax edit</i>.</p>
                <p>Here's an example of what selecting alignments looks like for one sentence:</p>

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>This tutorial will primerily demonstrate how to annotate through examples. When you read through the examples, think about how you would annotate the spans:</p>
                <example-sent  
                    noedits=true
                    explanation="This is a substitution. We see the “an easy fix” takes the place of “a straightforward solution” in the sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent><es class="original_span" data-id="0">A straightforward solution</es> for foggy car windows is run the heater.</template>

                </example-sent>

                <example-sent  
                    noedits=true
                    explanation="This is a deletion. We see “Contrary to popular belief” was entirely removed with nothing taking it's place in the sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent><ed>Contrary to popular belief</ed>, the moon is made of rocks, not cheese.</template>

                    noedits=true
                    explanation="This is an insertion. The span or its information didn't at all exist in the sentence.">

                <example-sent 
                    noedits=true
                    explanation="This is a syntax edit. Notice how the information in the sentence was unchanged, but the sentence was converted from a dependent and independent clause to two independent clauses.">
                    <template #complex-sent><ust noto>Although</ust><ss>1</ss> the subject lacked character developement<ust noto>, he</ust><ss>1</ss> grew in other ways.</template>

                </example-sent>

                <h2>How much do we select?</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally, you want to select the <b><i>smallest amount of text</i></b> as possible which contains <b><i>a single piece of information</i></b>. Sometimes there can be two different types of edits next to each other. If a edit seems too large, try to highlight multiple edits instead.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <example-sent
                    noedits=true
                    explanation="While “straightforward solution” and “, which can sometimes take a while,” appeared next to each other, the phrase “easy fix” is only substituting the words “starightforward solution” and the phrase “, which can sometimes takes a while,” isn’t contained anywhere else in the sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent>A <es>straightforward solution</es><ed>, which can sometimes take a while</ed>, for foggy car windows is to run the heater</template>
                    <template #simple-sent>An <es>easy fix</es> for foggy car windows is to run the heater</template>
                </example-sent>

                <example-sent 
                    noedits=true
                    explanation="Take a second to note all the changes. You may be faced with many changes in a single sentence.">
                    <template #complex-sent>The tallest timber-frame <es>structure</es> in the U.S.<ed>, by all accounts,</ed> is Carbon12, <ed>an eight-story condominium tower</ed> in Portland OR<ed>, completed in 2018</ed>.</template>

                </example-sent>

                <p>Remember! You may be tasked with identifing phrase and syntax edits at the same time.</p>

                    noedits=true
                    explanation="The sentences was converted from active to passive voice. However, notice that this required the verb “prepare” to be modified from present to past tense.

                <h2>Capitalization & Ending Period</h2>
                <p>Some of our AI outputs automatically lowercase all the words in their output, add spacing around punctuation or remove the ending period in the sentence, please ignore these changes.</p>
                <example-sent

                <h1>Annotating Deletions</h1>
                <p>Now we've selected the alignments, let's look at how to annotate them. We'll look at each edit type, starting with deletions.</p>
                <p>A deletion is an attempt to <b>simplify by deleting</b> unnecessary, irrelevant or complicated information or concepts.</p>

                <p>
                    When content is deleted from a sentence, it will always contain some amount of information. We also ask that you rate <i>how significant</i> the deleted content is to the <i>main idea</i> of the original sentence. You will rate the significance on a 4 point scale.
                </p>
                <h2>Examples</h2>

                <p>Hover over each piece of information to see which part of the sentence could be deleted to remove that information from the sentence. As you can see, sentences which communicate many ideas may be hard to narrow down whether a span is <i>significant</i>.</p>
                <p>In this case, the <i>main idea</i> of the sentence is <i>Booker T. Washington is an influential African American leader</i>. Deletions are necessary for text simplification, we just want to ensure this <i>main idea</i> is still being communicated.</p>

                <p>Sometimes you will see an insertion which adds new information which you may not know if it's correct or not. In this case, try to do basic research to see if the insertion is easily, verifiably correct. If there's any ambiguity, feel free to leave a comment on that sentence.</p>

                <h1>Annotating Substitutions</h1>
                <p>Now that you learn what are deletions and insertions, let's look at a more complicated edit type: the substitution. </p>
                <p>
                    An edit is a substitution anytime <b>information is retained</b> from the complex to simple sentence but the <b>wording is changed</b>. Parts of the “information” in the original phrase may be added or removed, but the core meaning of the phrase is transfered from the original to simplified sentence. Sometimes, a substitution even entirely <i>rewrites</i> the same phrase to a completely different meaning.
                </p>
                <h2>Disinguish between <i>substitution</i> and <i>deletion + insertion</i> pair</h2>
                <p>Sometimes an edit is a substitution, and somtimes it is an insertion and deletion. This can be hard to differentiate, but here’s a general guideline:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Substitution</b> - if both spans are about same type of content (actions, locations, ...)</li>
                    <li><b>Deletion + Insertion</b> - otherwise</li>
                </ul>
                <example-sent
                    noedits=true
                    >
                    <template #complex-sent>John was traveling in the summer in <ed>2020.</ed></template>
                    <template #simple-sent>John was traveling in the summer in <ei>Paris.</ei></template>
                </example-sent>

                <example-sent
                    noedits=true
                    >
                    <template #complex-sent>John was <es>traveling</es> <sub><i class="fa-solid fa-1 fa-2xs txt-substitution"></i></sub> in the summer in <es>2020.</es> <sub><i class="fa-solid fa-2 fa-2xs txt-substitution"></i></sub></template>

                </example-sent>

                <h2>Types of Substitution</h2>
                <p>As mentioned before, substitution is categorized into four types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Same meaning</b> - This is also a <i>paraphrase</i>, the AI attempted to <b>replace complicated words</b>, while retaining the meaning
                    </li><li>
                        <b>Less information</b> - Similar to an <i>insertion</i>, the AI attempted to modify the phrase to <b>add clarity</b> to the sentence
                    </li><li>
                        <b>More information</b> - Similar to a <i>deleton</i>, the AI attempted to modify the phrase to <b>remove unecessary information</b> from the phrase
                    </li><li>
                        <b>Different meaning</b> - The AI <b>removed all information</b> and replaced it with <b>new information</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Let’s look at some examples on how to determine what kind of information change is in a substitution:</p>

                <example-sent>
                    <template #complex-sent><es>Multinomial logistic</es> regression uses <es>the softmax function</es> to compute <es>probabilities</es>.</template>

                            explanation="“Logit” removes the “multinomial” modifier. You may be faced with models making replacements to words or concepts you may not understand. In this case you must use your best judgement to determine if information is being replaced or removed."

                <h1>Annotating Splits</h1>
                <p>A sentence split is an attempt to simplify the complex original sentence by
                    splitting it into two or more simpler sentences. Although the split edits are
                    easy to spot and are automatically marked as a <span class="txt-split">||</span> symbol,
                    split edits are usually accompanied by other edits like deletion, substitution, or insertion, which you need to mark as well.</p>
                <p class="mt1">
                    For example, to split a sentence, only changing the punctuation like comma to period and uppercasing the first letter of the second sentence is usually not enough to make the new sentences grammatically correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Splits can either be good or unnecessary. A good split is one that makes the sentence simpler and easier to understand. An unnecessary split is one that does not make the sentence simpler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A split can also introduce a grammar / fluency error, like any other edits.
                </p>

                <p>Congradulations on completing the tutorial! You should be able to understand all types of phrase-level and sentence-level edits and the nuances in rating these edits. In the 'Quiz', you will use the onboarding data we provided to test your ability to rate real outputs from our AI models. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.</p>

                <p>When annotating, if you come across a difficult decision, please refer to this tutorial and make comment explaining your thought process. You can also refer to the below summary of definitions and reminders.</p>                

                <h2>Phrase-level Edits</h2>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <ed>Deletion Edits</ed> - The AI attempted to <b><i>simplify by deleting</i></b> unnecessary information.
                        </li><li>
                            <ei>Insertion Edits</ei> - The AI attempted to <b><i>add clarity</i></b> by adding information which didn't previously exist.
                        </li><li>
                            <es>Substitution Edits</es> - The AI attempted to <b><i>reword a complicated phrase or concept</i></b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Identifying Change in Information</h2>

                <p>Information change can be broadly organized into the following categories. While <ei>insertions</ei> primerily add information and <ed>deletions</ed> primerily remove information, <es>substitutions</es> can be vague:</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>
                        Less information - Modify the phrase to <b>add clarity</b> to the sentence
                    </li><li>
                        Same meaning (<b>Paraphrase</b>) - Replace complicated words, while retaining the meaning
                    </li><li>
                        More information - Modify the phrase to <b>remove unecessary information</b> from the phrase
                    </li><li>
                        Different meaning - The AI removed all information and <b>replaced</b> it with new information
                    </li>
                </ul></p>

                <h2>Phrase-level Errors</h2>

                <p>Information addition (either through an <ei>insertion</ei> or <es>substitution</es>) may take the following forms:</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>
                        Elaboration - Added <b>meaningful and correct</b> extra information
                    </li><li>
                        Trivial Insertion - Added <b>minor</b> wording (the, a, etc.)
                    </li><li>
                        Hallucination - New information is introduced but <b>does not add clarity</b>
                    </li><li>
                        Irrelevant - New information is introduced which is <b>unrelated</b> to the main idea
                    </li><li>
                        Contradiction - Phrase added but clearly <b>contradicts</b> information in the original sentence
                    </li><li>
                        Redundant - Phrase added but <b>fails to contain new information</b>
                    </li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Information removal (either through an <ed>deletion</ed> or <es>substitution</es>) may exibit errors as well:</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>
                        Coreference Error - A <b>reference to a pronoun is deleted</b> and not referenced elsewhere in the sentence
                    </li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Lastly, any edit (syntactic or phrasal), may exhibit:</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>
                        Grammar & Fluency Error - A basic error in sentence grammar or fluency. <i>Fluency</i> refers to the quality or flow of a sentence and <i>grammar</i> refers to the basic conventions
                    </li>
                </ul></p>

                <h2>Sentence-level Edits</h2>

                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <esp>Splitting Edits</esp> - The AI attemped to <b><i>split a complex sentence</i></b> into two simpler sentences.
                        </li><li>
                            <er>Reordering Edits</er> - The AI attempted to <b><i>re-order</i></b> the words within a phrase or phrases within a sentence.
                        </li><li>
                            <est>Structural Edits</est> - The AI attemped to <b><i>modify attributes</i></b> (like the tense, structure or voice) of the sentence to present information more clearly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Remember <est>strcutural edits</est> are a combination of other edits! You can have up two three overlapping edits.</p>

                <h2>Decision Tree</h2>
                <p>This graphic outlines the different decisions you may make about edits in a sentence:</p>
